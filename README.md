# Complete The Sentence Program in Java
Completes The Entered Sentence With Using Trie Data Structure in Java

## Running The Program
Compile and run "CompleteTheSentence.java"

## How To Use The Program?
Program completes the entered sentence by using the data given. This source file (data) must be in TXT(.txt) format. Each line in the text file could contain only one sentence. There is an example "data.txt" in the repository. 

### How To Load Data?
While in the program, go to "File" then "Load" and select the desired text file. If "Overwrite" option is selected, previous data will be deleted. If it is not, then it adds the new data under the old data. 

Note: Loaded data will be saved in the same path as "CompleteTheSentence.java" with the name of "data.txt". Therefore, it could be changed directly from there.

## How Is It Working? 
The program loads all the data into a Trie Data Structure(char by char). When an input entered, it moves in the Trie path and finds the shortest meaningful sentence. Then shows the guesses.
